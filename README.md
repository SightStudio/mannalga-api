# SUPER INVENTION

## Live Server
- [mannal.ga](http://mannal.ga)
- [API Document](http://mannal.ga:8080/docs/index.html)

## Main Stack
Project is created with:
- Kotlin 1.4
- Spring boot
- MySQL

## Installation and Getting Started
### Setting MySQL DB And Schema
The MySQL database can create a schema by running [`src/course/sql/ddl.sql`](https://github.com/TASK-FORCE/super-invention/blob/develop/src/course/sql/ddl.sql) attached inside the project.<br>
If the DB schema setting is complete, enter the settings of the DB you set in the [`application.properties`](https://github.com/TASK-FORCE/super-invention/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

### Start Service
Super Invention software has backend and frontend separation.<br>
You can run the service by running the Front client after you run the Backend API server.

- [Frontend repository](https://github.com/TASK-FORCE/super-front)

## Project Features
#### CI/CD with Github Action
All Pull Requests generated by developers automatically perform build/testing to check if they can be run normally. This eliminates the need to consider whether this code is executable when conducting code reviews for Pull Requests.<br><br>
The Super-invention project has built, tested, and deployed pipelines all going through Github Action. We have created two versions of the action so that we can deploy both the .jar file and the container environment, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/TASK-FORCE/super-invention/tree/develop/.github/workflows).

#### Code-Review Driven Development
Development features will not be long without code review. Through this, we were able to improve the quality of the code and understand the behavior of the code written by the team members.

#### Test code based API Document
Communicating APIs with front-end developers was not easy. The API's call conditions, permissions, parameters, return values, etc. had to be clearly communicated, and managing them was almost impossible without documentation. So we documented all the behavior of the API through Restdocs. Front-end developers no longer need to ask back-end developers what this API does.<br><br>
The result of this code's operation will generate the following documents.<br>
```
result.andExpect(status().isOk)
    .andDo(
        document("club-withdraw",
            getDocumentRequest(),
            getDocumentResponse(),
            pathParameters(parameterWithName("clubSeq").description("모임 시퀀스.")),
            responseFields(
                *commonResponseField()
            )
        )
    )
```

#### Type-Safe JPQL via using QueryDSL
```
@Transactional
override fun findMeetingApplicationByUserAndMeetingSeq(clubUserParam: ClubUser, meetingSeq: Long): MeetingApplication {
    return from(meetingApplication)
        .join(meetingApplication.meeting, meeting)
        .join(meetingApplication.clubUser, clubUser)
        .join(meeting.club, club)
        .where(
            clubUser.seq.eq(clubUserParam.seq), meeting.seq.eq(meetingSeq)
        ).fetchOne()
}
```
